# Project: In the Mood for Love (花样年华)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and documenting the cinematic composition of Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, *In the Mood for Love*. Through a series of structural diagrams, we explore the visual language of isolation, repression, and unspoken desire.

## Project Scope
- **Director:** Wong Kar-wai
- **Cinematography:** Christopher Doyle, Mark Lee Ping-bin
- **Goal:** To extract and visualize the geometric logic behind the film's iconic "frame within a frame" and spatial compression techniques.

## Project Status
- [x] **Initialization**: Movie metadata and director style documented.
- [x] **Quantity Definition**: Set to **3** composition diagrams.
- [x] **Analysis & Logic**: Deep analysis and structural geometry definitions (`/diagram`).
- [ ] **Rendering**: SVG diagram generation (`/render`).

## Directory Structure
- `/01_reference/`: Movie metadata and visual research.
- `/02_analysis/`: Detailed scene-by-scene composition analysis.
- `/03_structure/`: Mathematical and geometric definitions of frame composition.
- `/04_prompts/`: Rendering instructions for the SVG generation engine.
- `/05_diagrams/`: Final high-precision SVG composition diagrams.
